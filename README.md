# [Built With Elm](http://builtwithelm.co)

[![ICARE](https://icarebadge.com/ICARE-white.png)](https://icarebadge.com)


A list of projects and apps built with Elm.

This site is meant to showcase the awesome work the Elm community is doing. I
wanted to create a place for people to have their work recognized, especially if
it is open source (proprietary projects definitely welcome though!), and stand
as examples for those who are new to the language.

## Submitting a project
Just submit a PR with your info added to the beginning of the array in
`/data/projects.json` and a screenshot in `/data/images`! Please ensure that the
screenshot is 1000px x 800px and take care to choose the best format and do some
optimization too. If your project is open source, fill in your repository url as
well as the url of your project. If it is not, just leave it as `null` (this
field is decoded with `Json.Decode.maybe` :smile:).

## Contributing
Want to contribute to this site? Nice! Submit a PR or leave an issue. Feedback
is encouraged and graciously accepted and my hope is that this can be a fun
community project for people of all skill levels to contribute. If you do
decide to submit code, please be sure to run it through
[elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) prior to submitting your pull
request. Get in touch with me at @luke_dot_js on Twitter or at @luke in the
elmlang Slack if you'd like!
